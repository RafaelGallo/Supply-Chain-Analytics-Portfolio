Below is a **complete, professional README written entirely in English**, ready to be used directly in a GitHub repository as a **Supply Chain Analytics portfolio project**.
The content is structured for **recruiters, data teams, and business stakeholders**. This repository contains a collection of **end-to-end Data Science projects applied to Supply Chain**, using real-world datasets related to **logistics, e-commerce operations, order management, and greenhouse gas emissions**.The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate how **data-driven approaches** can support **operational efficiency, cost reduction, service level improvement, and sustainability** across the supply chain.

## Project Objectives

* Apply **Data Science techniques** to real Supply Chain problems
* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with a business-oriented mindset
* Build and analyze **Supply Chain KPIs**
* Explore **predictive and analytical models** for logistics and demand
* Analyze **environmental and sustainability impacts (ESG)**
* Create a **professional portfolio** for roles in:

  * Supply Chain Analytics
  * Data Science
  * Business Intelligence
  * Operations and Logistics

## Business Context

Supply Chain Management involves several critical processes, including:

* Demand planning
* Inventory management
* Order fulfillment
* Logistics and transportation
* Supplier performance
* Sustainability and emissions control

Poor decision-making in these areas can lead to:

* Stockouts and overstocking
* Delivery delays
* High logistics costs
* Reduced customer satisfaction
* Increased environmental impact

This project shows how **data analytics and machine learning** can improve visibility, efficiency, and strategic decision-making across the supply chain.

## Datasets Used

### 1. Supply Chain Analysis Dataset

**Description:**
A general Supply Chain dataset containing information about products, sales, inventory, and operational performance.

Dataset link:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis)

**Use cases:**

* Sales and inventory analysis
* Bottleneck identification
* Operational KPIs
* Product-level performance analysis

### 2. Ecommerce Order and Supply Chain Dataset

**Description:**
A comprehensive e-commerce dataset including **orders, customers, products, and logistics information**.

Dataset link:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bytadit/ecommerce-order-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bytadit/ecommerce-order-dataset)

**Use cases:**

* Order lifecycle analysis
* Delivery time and delay analysis
* Customer behavior and retention
* Logistics efficiency evaluation

### 3. Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Dataset

**Description:**
A dataset focused on **greenhouse gas emissions across supply chains**, supporting sustainability and ESG analysis.

Dataset link:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/supply-chain-greenhouse-gas-emission](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/supply-chain-greenhouse-gas-emission)

**Use cases:**

* Environmental impact analysis
* Emission sources identification
* Sector and regional comparison
* ESG-driven decision support

## Analytical Approach

### Project Methodology

1. **Business Understanding**

   * Definition of Supply Chain problems
   * Identification of relevant KPIs

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

   * Handling missing values
   * Data normalization and transformation
   * Feature engineering

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Statistical analysis
   * Business-focused visualizations
   * Pattern and outlier detection

4. **Supply Chain KPIs**

   * Lead Time
   * Order Fulfillment Rate
   * Inventory Turnover
   * On-Time Delivery Rate
   * Emissions per unit or activity

5. **Modeling (when applicable)**

   * Regression models
   * Classification models
   * Predictive analysis for delays and demand

6. **Business Insights**

   * Actionable recommendations
   * Operational and strategic impact

## Example Analyses

* Logistics performance by region
* Delivery delays and root causes
* High-impact products in inventory
* Customer purchasing behavior
* Supply Chain bottleneck detection
* Carbon emission analysis by sector
* Cost, time, and sustainability trade-offs

## Tools and Technologies
